# password-generator

## Assignment Task

As the student, I was assigned to create a password generator to help create a random password for the user. I wrote a code using Javascript and added what needed to be done to the starter code that was provided. I included functions, an array, for loops and a return function.


## User Story

```
AS A developer 
I WANT to create a code that randomly generates a password for future employees
SO THAT they can have a secure and unique password that provides strong security

```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the employee needs a password no one can access
WHEN the employee clicks the Generate Password button
THEN prompts are displayed with the requirements for the password
WHEN the employee selects the correct requirements 
THEN they must also input a password with a minimum length of eight characters and a maximum character length of 128
WHEN the employee inputs the correct requirements
THEN they are asked to chose between using an Uppercase or Lowercase character as well as if they want Numbers or Special characters in their password
